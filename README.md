  ðŸ“ˆ Greenfield Sales Performance: An End-to-End Analytics Project
</h1>

<p align="center">
  A comprehensive project that transforms raw sales data into a strategic business asset, combining powerful Python EDA with an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

My objective was to transform raw sales data into actionable insights for the fictional company, Greenfield. The project was designed to:

* **Uncover the "why"** behind sales performance, moving beyond simple numbers to understand trends and drivers.
* **Empower business leaders** to make proactive, data-backed decisions.
* **Demonstrate a full analytics workflow**, from data cleaning and analysis to dynamic visualization.

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

The project leverages a robust and complementary toolset:

* **Python**: Used for the foundational data analysis and a deep dive into the dataset's characteristics.
    * **Pandas**: For data manipulation, cleaning, and preparation.
    * **NumPy**: For efficient numerical operations.
    * **Matplotlib**: For creating exploratory data visualizations (EDA) that guided the dashboard's design.
* **Power BI**: The core visualization tool used to create the final interactive dashboard.
    * **DAX**: For building custom measures and KPIs.
    * **Power Query**: For data transformation and modeling.

## ðŸ“Š The Story: From Data to Impact

This project is a narrative told in two parts:

### Part 1: The Data Detective Work (Python EDA)

I began by performing a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data's hidden story. My key findings from this phase included:

* **Seasonality**: I discovered clear monthly sales peaks, which directly informed the design of the "Monthly Revenue Rhythm" visual.
* **Profitability Drivers**: A scatter plot of `Unit Price` vs. `Profit Margin %` helped me identify and categorize high-value products, which I later translated into a core dashboard visual.
* **Data Quality**: I handled outliers and inconsistencies to ensure the dataset was clean and reliable for visualization.

### Part 2: The Business Storytelling (Power BI Dashboard)

Using the insights from my EDA, I built a three-page interactive dashboard that serves as a single source of truth for Greenfield's sales performance.

#### 1. Executive Overview & Trends

This page provides a high-level summary of key performance indicators (KPIs), including **Total Revenue ($1.2B)**, **Total Profit ($461.8M)**, and **Profit Margin (37.36%)**. It features line charts that track monthly revenue and profit to easily spot trends.

#### 2. Product & Channel Performance

This section dives deeper, identifying the **"Revenue Champions"** and **"High-Margin Heroes."** It uses donut charts to break down revenue and profit by sales channel, allowing for strategic optimization of resources.

#### 3. Geographic & Customer Insights

This page offers a regional and customer-level view of the business. It highlights top-performing states and customers and uses a map visual to show geographical sales distribution.

## ðŸš€ Impact & Key Learnings

This project wasn't just about creating a report; it was about creating a tool that could drive business change. By completing this project independently, I gained hands-on experience in:

* **End-to-end Project Management**: From raw data to a polished final product.
* **Translating Data to Insights**: Using technical analysis to answer real-world business questions.
* **Data Visualization Storytelling**: Crafting a compelling narrative through visual design.

This solution provides a powerful blueprint for any business looking to transform its data into a strategic advantage.
