1.ðŸ“ˆ Greenfield Sales Performance: An End-to-End Analytics Project
This repository contains my end-to-end analytics project, showcasing a comprehensive approach to business intelligenceâ€”from foundational data exploration in Python to an interactive, business-facing dashboard in Power BI.

2.ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
My objective was to transform raw sales data into actionable insights for the fictional company, Greenfield. The project was designed to:

Uncover the "why" behind sales performance, moving beyond simple numbers to understand trends and drivers.

Empower business leaders to make proactive, data-backed decisions.

Demonstrate a full analytics workflow, from data cleaning and analysis to dynamic visualization.

3.ðŸ›  Tech Stack
The project leverages a robust and complementary toolset:

Python: Used for the foundational data analysis and a deep dive into the dataset's characteristics.

Pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and preparation.

NumPy: For efficient numerical operations.

Matplotlib: For creating exploratory data visualizations (EDA) that guided the dashboard's design.

Power BI: The core visualization tool used to create the final interactive dashboard.

DAX: For building custom measures and KPIs.

Power Query: For data transformation and modeling.

4.ðŸ“Š The Story: From Data to Impact
This project is a narrative told in two parts:

Part 1: The Data Detective Work (Python EDA)
I began by performing a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data's hidden story. My key findings from this phase included:

Seasonality: I discovered clear monthly sales peaks, which directly informed the design of the "Monthly Revenue Rhythm" visual.

Profitability Drivers: A scatter plot of Unit Price vs. Profit Margin % helped me identify and categorize high-value products, which I later translated into a core dashboard visual.

Data Quality: I handled outliers and inconsistencies to ensure the dataset was clean and reliable for visualization.

Part 2: The Business Storytelling (Power BI Dashboard)
Using the insights from my EDA, I built a three-page interactive dashboard that serves as a single source of truth for Greenfield's sales performance.

1. Executive Overview & Trends
This page provides a high-level summary of key performance indicators (KPIs), including Total Revenue ($1.2B), Total Profit ($461.8M), and Profit Margin (37.36%). It features line charts that track monthly revenue and profit to easily spot trends.

2. Product & Channel Performance
This section dives deeper, identifying the "Revenue Champions" and "High-Margin Heroes." It uses donut charts to break down revenue and profit by sales channel, allowing for strategic optimization of resources.

3. Geographic & Customer Insights
This page offers a regional and customer-level view of the business. It highlights top-performing states and customers and uses a map visual to show geographical sales distribution.

5.ðŸš€ Impact & Key Learnings
This project wasn't just about creating a report; it was about creating a tool that could drive business change. By completing this project independently, I gained hands-on experience in:

End-to-end Project Management: From raw data to a polished final product.

Translating Data to Insights: Using technical analysis to answer real-world business questions.

Data Visualization Storytelling: Crafting a compelling narrative through visual design.

This solution provides a powerful blueprint for any business looking to transform its data into a strategic advantage.
